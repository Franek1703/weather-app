# Weather Application

## Overview

This task involves developing a basic weather application utilizing the free API from https://www.weatherapi.com. The application should display:

- Current temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness
- Forecast for these conditions for the next day
- Use graphical representation of the data
- Graph showing the temperature forecast for the upcoming 12 hours
- Bonus: A morning alert at 8 AM if there's a high chance (70% or above) of rain during the day

### Technical Requirements

- The app must be built using the bloc architecture from the flutter_bloc package
- Don't forget the tests (unit, bloc, integration)

### Design

You can do whatever you want just make it pretty, maybe look at dribbble for inspiration or other weather apps.
